# VR_Cooking

A project I worked on with Tatjana Kasecker. We wanted to experiment with VR by making a small game in Unity. The goal of the game is to prepare spaghetti by cooking noodles, washing and cutting vegetables, and combining everything in a pot.


We wrote the scripts and modeled all assets by ourselves. The scripts I worked on are in the “Scripts” folder.


Gameplay footage:

(The game is supposed to be played with a VR headset. While recording I had to use the device simulator which is why the controls look questionable in the video. When played with a headset the controls work a lot better)
